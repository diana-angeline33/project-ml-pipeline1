# Project Goals and Success Criteria

## Main Goal
Build an ML model that identifies the most frequently tested topics from past question papers to help students revise efficiently.

## Secondary Goals
- Create a simple demo interface (web UI / Streamlit) to show top topics predicted by the model.
- Organize GitHub repo for portfolio presentation with clear documentation.

## Success Metrics
- Precision/Recall of top N topics vs. actual important topics.
- Coverage: proportion of important topics included in top N list.
- Time taken to process question papers (optional).

## Technical Goals
- Keep track of input data versions.
- Write basic unit tests for key functions (e.g., OCR, text cleaning).
- Make environment reproducible (requirements.txt listing libraries).

## Deliverable Goals
- Clean README with instructions for running the project.
- Architecture diagram showing the ML pipeline steps.
- Short demo video showing the model predicting top topics.
